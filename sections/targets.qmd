## Targets

[Targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) is an extension developed by Will Landau that allows you to organize a project in the form of a processing pipeline, made up of different stages, and automatically managing the dependencies between them.

This organization has several advantages:

> -   it allows all pipeline stages to be described in a dedicated file, and forces the various stages to be separated into separate functions, making the project easier to read and maintain

> -   it facilitates reproducibility of processing, as it guarantees that all steps have been carried out in the right order and in a new environment

> -   it optimizes calculation times, because in the event of modification, only those steps that require it are restarted

# How does it work?

## Use functions

Transform blocks of code into functions by wrapping them into ` <- function() { my_code }` and setting appropriate parameters.


<br>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
mydata     <- read.csv("mydata.csv")

data2      <- clean(mydata)
data3      <- transform(data2)
data4      <- erase_na(data3)
data_clean <- transform(data_4)
```

<br> <br>


:::{.fragment}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
mydata  <- read.csv("mydata.csv")

wrangle <- function(data){
  data2      <- clean(data)
  data3      <- transform(data2)
  data4      <- erase_na(data3)
  data_clean <- transform(data_4)
  return(data_clean)
}

data_clean <- wrangle(mydata)
```

## Targets

In **targets**, a data analysis pipeline is a collection of target objects that express the individual steps of the workflow

> - a target is a step of your pipeline (can also be an input file or a `Quarto` report)

> - each target is defined using the function `tar_target()`, providing the name of the target as first argument and the function to create it as a second argument, there is a third optional argument to specify the 'type' of the target

> - dependencies between targets are exposed because upstream targets are arguments of the functions used to build downstream targets

> - this allow to visualize the pipeline as a dependency graph

## Creating the pipeline

The pipeline is written in an R file, by default `Targets` looks  for a `_targets.R` file located at the root of your project.

**But** this can be changed and the pipeline can be defined in an `R` file of your choice, you'll have to set it up using the following (e.g. in your `make.R` file):

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# ---- project execution
targets::tar_config_set(
  store  = "outputs/pipeline/",
  script = "analyses/pipeline.R"
)
```

Note that we also specified a custom location to store the targets.

<br>

:::{.fragment}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(targets)

list(
  # Make the workflow depends on the raw data file
  tar_target(name = raw_data_file, command = here::here("data", "airquality.csv"), 
             format = "file"), 
  
  # Read the data and return a data.frame
  tar_target(name = raw_data, command = read.csv(raw_data_file)),
  
  # Transform the data
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  
  # Explore the data (custom function)
  tar_target(hist, hist(data$Ozone)), 
  
  # Model the data
  tar_target(fit, lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))
)
```

  # Model the data

)
```

then visualise it:

```{r}
#| eval: false

targets::tar_visnetwork()

```

## Creating the pipeline

<br>

All target script files have these requirements:

<br>

:::{.incremental}
1. Load the [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) package itself.  

<br>

2. Load your custom functions and global objects into the R session: `targets::tar_source()`.  

<br>

3. Define individual targets with the `tar_target()` function. 
Each target is an intermediate step of the workflow. At minimum, a target must have a **name** and an **R expression** but it's better if it uses a function that you defined in `R/`.  

<br>

4. Every target script must end with a list of your `tar_target()` objects.

## Running the pipeline

![](images/airquality-pipeline.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

Once the pipeline is ready and inspected via targets::tar_visnetwork(), you can run it with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
targets::tar_make()
```

:::{.fragment}

## Retrieving the results (the targets)

Targets objects are stored in the `Targets store` but you d'ont need to think about it when retrieving your results.

Just load or read targets with their names:

- `Loading` a target in the current workspace:

```{r}
#| eval: false

targets::tar_load("hist")

plot(hist)

```

![](../images/hist_Ozone.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Retrieving the results (the targets)

Targets objects are stored in the `Targets store` but you d'ont need to think about it when retrieving your results.

- `Reading` a target value and assign it to a new object:

```{r}
#| eval: false

histo <- targets::tar_read("hist")

plot(histo)

```

![](../images/hist_Ozone.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

# Targets loves changes


## Changing the pipeline

Let's modidify the target "hist" to use ggplot2 instead of R base graphics.

We will create a function that generate a `ggplot2` histogram object and write it's definition in `R/functions.R`:

```{r}
#| eval: false

R/functions.R

make_hist <- function(dat) {
  
  #dat = targets::tar_read("data")
  
  ggplot2::ggplot(data = dat, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = Ozone)) +
    ggplot2::geom_histogram()
  
}

```

And modify the pipeline to use it:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|17"

library(targets)

tar_source() #load functions in R/

list(
  # Make the workflow depends on the raw data file
  tar_target(name = raw_data_file, command = here::here("data", "airquality.csv"), 
             format = "file"), 
  
  # Read the data and return a data.frame
  tar_target(name = raw_data, command = read.csv(raw_data_file)),
  
  # Transform the data
  tar_target(data, raw_data |> dplyr::filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  
  # Explore the data (custom function)
  tar_target(hist, make_hist(data)), 
  
  # Model the data
  tar_target(fit, lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))
)

```

# Input / Output Files


## External input files

<br>

To reproducibly track an external input file, you need to define a new target that has:

<br>

:::{.incremental}

1. A command that returns the file path as a character vector, and 

2. specify `format = "file"` in `tar_target()`.

:::

:::{.fragment}

<br> <br>

When the target runs in the pipeline, the returned character vector gets recorded, and `Targets` watches the data file and invalidates the target when that file changes.

:::

:::{.fragment}

<br>

To track multiple files this way, simply define a multi-element character vector where each element is a path.

:::

:::{.fragment}
<br>

Each element can also be a directory, but this directory must not be empty at the time the target runs.

:::


## External input files

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(targets)

path_to_data <- function() {
  "data/raw_data.csv"
}

list(
  tar_target(raw_data_file, path_to_data(), format = "file"),
  tar_target(raw_data, read.csv(raw_data_file))
)
```


## Several independant input files

A target with `format = "file"` treats the entire set of files as an irreducible bundle.

That means in order to "branch" over files, each file should be associated  with its own target.

This is not optimal at all. Using the argument `pattern` solve this by providing a way to dynamically create targets for each input file. 

Here is a pipeline that begins with data files and loads each into a different dynamic branch.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(targets)

list(
  tar_target(paths, c("data_file_1.csv", "data_file_2.csv")),
  tar_target(files, paths, format = "file", pattern = map(paths)),
  tar_target(data, read.csv(files), pattern = map(files))
)
```

The [`tar_files()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/reference/tar_files.html) function from the [`tarchetypes`](https://github.com/ropensci/tarchetypes) package is shorthand for the first two targets above.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(targets)

list(
  tarchetypes::tar_files(files, c("data_file_1.csv", "data_file_2.csv")),
  tar_target(data, read.csv(files), pattern = map(files))
)
```


## External output files

Output files have the same mechanics as input files. The target uses `format = "file"`, and the return value is a vector of paths to generated files.

The only difference here is that the target's R command writes to storage before it returns a value.

For example, here is an output file target that saves a visualization.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tar_target(plot_file, save_plot_and_return_path(), format = "file")
```


Here, our custom `save_plot_and_return_path()` function does exactly what the name describes.

```{r}
#| eval: false
save_plot_and_return_path <- function() {
  plot <- ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg))
  ggsave(here::here("outputs", "plot_file.png"), plot, 
         width = 7, height = 7)
  return(file.path("outputs", "plot_file.png"))
}
```


# Literate programming

## Literate programming

<br>

If you render a Quarto report as part of a target, the report should be lightweight: mostly prose, minimal code, fast execution, and no output other than the rendered HTML/PDF document.

<br>
<br>

:::{.callout-important}

In other words, Quarto reports are just targets that document prior results.

The bulk of the computation should have already happened upstream, and the most of the code chunks in the report itself should be terse calls to `tar_read()` and `tar_load()`.

:::

## Literate programming
![](images/qmd-source.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

The report depends on targets `fit` and `hist`.

The use of `tar_read()` and `tar_load()` allows us to run the report outside the pipeline.

As long as the `Targets store` folder has data on the required targets from a previous `tar_make()`, you can open the RStudio IDE, edit the report, and click the Render button like you would for any other Quarto report.

## Literate programming

The target definition function to render Quarto documents is part of the [`tarchetypes`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/) `R` package and looks like this.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tarchetypes::tar_quarto(report, "report.qmd") # Just defines a target object.

```

. . .

Because symbols `fit` and `hist` appear in the report via `tar_load()` and `tar_read()`, `targets` knows that `report` depends on `fit` and `hist`.

![](images/qmd-source.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}


## Literate programming

When we put the `report` target in the pipeline, these dependency relationships show up in the graph.


```{r}
#| eval: false

library(targets)

tar_source() #load functions in R/

list(
  # Make the workflow depends on the raw data file
  tar_target(name = raw_data_file, command = here::here("data", "airquality.csv"), 
             format = "file"), 
  
  # Read the data and return a data.frame
  tar_target(name = raw_data, command = read.csv(raw_data_file)),
  
  # Transform the data
  tar_target(data, raw_data |> dplyr::filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  
  # Explore the data (custom function)
  tar_target(hist, make_hist(data)), 
  
  # Model the data
  tar_target(fit, lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)),
  
  tarchetypes::tar_quarto(report, "report.qmd")
)
```

## Literate programming

When we put the `report` target in the pipeline, these dependency relationships show up in the graph.

![](images/targets-tar_vis_4.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}
<br> <br>

As always, `tar_make()` will run the pipeline and compile the report.
